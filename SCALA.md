# Scala

Scala was first published in 2003 by Martin Odersky - who previously wrote a lot of the Java compiler `javac`.

- It's staticly typed
- It supports object-oriented and functional features, it allows for imperitive programming
- It compiles to JVM bytecode or to Javascript
- It has a syntax that has evolved from Java but is now a lot more concise and powerful

## Functional Programming

Functional programming has been around in academic and limited commercial contexts for ages, but is now becoming a lot more mainstream.

The key idea is to make code comprised of functions that take in inputs and produce outputs that only depend on the inputs. This reduces the number of things a developer has to think about at any one time, and makes it much easier not to miss things!

Functional programming also helps with code reuse, meaningful error handling, writing good quality tests and making code much easier for new developers to understand.

The book "Functional Programming in Scala" (available in Safari Books) is a bit of a bible in this field which is also approachable to anyone with a little coding experience. The first couple of chapters illustrate really nicely some of the benefits of a functional approach.
